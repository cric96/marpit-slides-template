# Marpit Slides Template
A template used to generate and share slides with [marpit](https://marpit.marp.app/)

The presentation files have to be named as *presentation.md*, if your prefer another name you can change it in [./workflows/marpit.yml].

This repository, for each push, produces:
  - a release containing the PDF file
  - a static site with the slides
